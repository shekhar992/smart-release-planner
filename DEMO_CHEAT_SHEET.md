## 💬 KEY SOUNDBITES

### Problem
> "Engineering teams waste 5-10 hours per planning session in Excel hell. No conflict detection. No capacity management. No collaboration."

### Solution
> "We automate what took hours. Conflicts detected instantly. Capacity calculated with PTO and holidays. Changes sync automatically."

### Value
> "That's $10K-20K/year in wasted time we eliminate for $3-5K/year. 50-75% cost savings, 10x time savings."

### Market
> "100,000+ companies with 10-50 person eng teams. $300M-500M TAM. We're targeting teams spending $15-50K/year solving this manually."

### Traction
> "3 design partnerships lined up. Ready to pilot. Conversion path clear: Free trial → Paid pilot → Annual contract."

### Ask
> "$500K gets us to JIRA integration, real-time collab, and 50-person team capacity. 18-month runway. $1M ARR target at 200 teams."

## 🚨 IF SOMETHING BREAKS

1. **Don't panic, don't apologize**
2. Say: "Let me pull up the backup"
3. Switch to screenshots/video
4. **Keep talking about value, not tech**
5. Offer: "I'll send you a full walkthrough after this"
